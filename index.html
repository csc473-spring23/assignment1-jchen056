    <h2>Why did you register for this course?</h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>This course could count as my CS elective(Originally, I double majored in CS and Applied Math).</li>
        <li>I am interested in the web development. In particular, I am interested in building a personal website to market myself. Here is <a href="https://jchen056.github.io/" target="_blank">my work in progress</a>. 
          Specifically, I am trying to add more interactivity to the website and build some backend. At the end of the course, I hope I can make my personal website more interative and visually appealing.  </li>
        <li>HTML, CSS, and Javascript are great skills to put on my resume. After completing the course, I will be more confident to put those skills on my resume.</li>
        <li>More importantly, I want to learn how to solve problems on my own by learning what to google and how to incorporate new knowledge into my website.</li>
      </ol></p>
    <h2>What's an interesting fact about you that isn't likely to be true about anyone else in the course?</h2>
    <p>Frankly speaking, I am a quite boring person; my life is simply three dots on a line: school, work, and home. During the busiest times in the summer, I was juggling three jobs, taking a summer class, and helping my family with their business. Looking back, I do not even know how I survived and what motivated me to get through all the storms. During the winterbreak, I tried to rejuvenate by taking a road trip with my family to Disney in Orlando. Even during the trip, I was working on assignments for my winter class. 
      It seems that I have been used to the life of spinning all day long. 
    </p>
    <h2>(Optional) Anything else you want me to know?</h2>
    <p><ul>
      <li>I major in applied mathematics and minor in computer science and economics, which is quite different from other students taking the course.</li>
      <li>I am interested in data science and exploring its appplications in different fields, such as finance and sustainability. Having a child living in me, I am ebullient to explore, learn, and grow; I take every opportunity that is presented to me to develop my technical skills while exploring my interests.</li>
    </ul></p>
